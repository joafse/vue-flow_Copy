# Connection Radius

This examples shows you how to use the `connectionRadius` prop.
This prop allows you to pass a number which will be used to determine the radius at which a connection line will snap to the nearest handle.
In addition, we create a custom connection line which will color the handles (you can omit this and just use `connectionRadius`).
